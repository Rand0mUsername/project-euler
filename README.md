# project-euler
- My solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.
- Mostly written in C++, occasionally Java, Python and Haskell.
- Most of these aren't well commented since they're too simple (+ I was lazy), but as I progress to more difficult problems I will try to add insightful comments. Still, if you want to discuss any of these feel free to hit me up.
